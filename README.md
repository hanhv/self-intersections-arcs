# Self-intersection numbers of arcs
- The main function is `intersection.py`: computing the self-intersection of a word `w=n_1 x_1 ... x_k n_2`
- Note: surface word for a pair of pants: `a1A3b2B3`
- Example: 
```commandline
my_word = '1baBA2'  # self-intersection of 1baBA2 is 4
print("intersection", my_word, intersection(my_word))
```
